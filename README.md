# 🧠⚛️ AI Symmetry Visualizer

**Mesmerizing math meets AI-powered art!**

---

## ✨ What is this?

An interactive web app where you:
- Type a group name (e.g., `D4`, `A5`, `SO(3)`), symmetry order, or algebraic expression
- Choose a style: tiling, polyhedron, fractal, or animation
- Click **Generate**
- See stunning, shareable visuals blending pure mathematics with artistic flair!

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧮 **Group Theory Engine**: Recognizes and visualizes algebraic groups (cyclic, dihedral, platonic, etc.)
- 🎨 **Procedural Art**: Generates tilings, 3D polyhedra, and fractals using group symmetries
- 🤖 **AI Styling**: Style transfer, text-to-image, and AI color palettes for unique looks
- 🕸️ **Cayley Graphs**: Visualize group structure
- 🖌️ **User Drawing**: Apply symmetries to your own shapes
- 🌀 **Animation**: Looping GIFs and interactive visuals
- 📤 **Export**: Download as SVG, GIF, or 3D model
- 📝 **Auto-Explanation**: AI-generated math/art descriptions
- 💡 **AI Suggestions**: Discover new groups to explore
